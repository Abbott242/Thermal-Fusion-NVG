CAD and associated documentation for my multispectral night vision monocular

Who am I? I'm an engineneering student in Canada
What is this project? A homemade NVG, similar to the PSQ-20 series. 
What could you do with it? This is here to be used as inspiration, though you could reproduce this if you so desire. Note that many design choices were made due to lack of modern parts, so there are flaws inherent to the design (long optical train, heavy weight, high f-stop lens). If you seriously want to build one and have access to more modern eequipment, I'd reccomend designing your own while using the lessons I've learned here.
